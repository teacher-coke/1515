This is a challenging problem!

x06. Determine the factored form
You may use the functions you created in previous assignments

def Factored(a,b,c):
  '''
  input parameters:
  a, b, c: signed float
  These are the coefficients in the quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c = 0
  
  Write the equation in a nicely formatted factored form. This means no fractions
  
  return:
  list : 2 string literals representing the factors.  The order does not matter
  None if the quadratic can not be factored
